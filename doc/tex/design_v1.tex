\REFSEC{sec:pseudo:v1} shows the mnemonics and pseudo-code functions
for \ISE{1}.
This variant is the simplest conceptual approach, and
is also described in Section $4.2$ of \cite{TilGro:06}.
The AES state is stored column-wise in $4$ $32$-bit words.
Each instruction applies the forward/inverse AES SubBytes or
MixColumn function to a single word.
The instructions have only a single source and destination register,
making them very compact in terms of encoding points.
\REFFIG{fig:design:fu_block:v1} shows a block diagram of these
instructions.

The authors of \cite{TilGro:06} note that these instructions do not
efficiently support the ShiftRows operation of AES.  We reproduce their
optimisation addressing this in the variant $2$ instructions.

A single encryption round using this variant requires
$4$ {\tt saes.v1.encs} instructions to perform SubBytes,
$4$ {\tt saes.v1.encm} instructions to perform MixColumns,
$4$ load-word instructions to fetch the round key
and
$4$ {\tt xor} instructions to add the round key.
As noted, the key inefficiency of these instructions is the
lack of ShiftRows support, which takes $31$ instructions using the
base {\tt rv32i} ISA.
\REFFIG{fig:round:v1} shows an example AES encrypt round function
using this variant.
