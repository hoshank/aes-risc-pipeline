\REFSEC{sec:pseudo:v4} shows the mnemonics and pseudo-code functions
for variant \ISE{4}.
These instructions are designed to take advantage of a 64-bit
data-path.
The AES State is stored in $2$ $64$-bit words: column $0$ in the
lower word of {\tt rs1}, and column $3$ in the upper word of {\tt rs2}.
Hence, the entire AES state can be passed to an instruction, but only
half of the next round state can be written back owing to the
$2$-read-$1$-write constraint of RISC-V.

This is the approach taken by the Oracle SPARC \cite[Page 109]{SPARC:16}
instructions, which use dedicated instructions to compute
columns $0$ and $1$ ({\tt AES\_EROUND01}) followed by
columns $2$ and $3$ ({\tt AES\_EROUND23}).

We improve upon this by utilising the Equivalent Inverse Cipher
construction of AES \cite[Section 5.4.4, Page 27]{FIPS:197} within
the instructions.
Specifically, the SubBytes and ShiftRows steps commute, allowing
the encrypt and decrypt round functions to apply (inverse)
ShiftRows, SubBytes and MixColumns all in the same order.
The nature of ShiftRows then means that by
swapping the order of {\tt rs1} and {\tt rs2}
for the {\tt enc*} and {\tt dec*} instructions, we can compute {\em either}
columns $1$ and $2$ or columns $3$ and $4$ of the next round state with the
same instruction.
Thus, our solution requires half of the instruction encoding points
for the encrypt/decrypt round functions: $4$ v.s. $8$.

The {\tt ks*} instructions allow the a new round key to be computed
in $3$ instructions.
Again, we improve upon the SPARC solution by requiring only two,
$2$-operand instruction encodings.
This is done by allowing the {\tt saes.v4.ks1} instruction
to optionally apply the round constant based on the value of
it's {\tt rcon} immediate.
See \REFFIG{fig:pseudo:v4} for the pseudo-code of this
operation.

A single encryption round using this variant requires
$2$ load-double instructions to fetch the round key,
$2$ {\tt xor} instructions to add the round key
and
$2$ {\tt saes.v4.encs[m]} instructions to compute SubBytes, ShiftRows
and MixColumns.
\REFFIG{fig:round:v4} shows an example AES encrypt round function
using this variant.

This proposal is similar to \cite{SPARC:16} in how it utilises
a 64-bit data-path.
It sources only two general purpose registers however (rather than $3$),
making it less demanding to implement in the context of the wider
system.
The addition of an extra source register would save $2$ instructions
per round by allowing AddRoundKey to be included, at the expense
of breaking the RISC-V design principles.
