RISC-V is a (relatively) new ISA, with its origins at UC Berkley
\cite{riscv:1}.
The core ISA is extremely simple, consisting of only $50$ instructions.
The ISA defines $32$ general purpose registers, with register $0$ always
tied to the value $0$.
The base ISA comes in $32$, $64$ and $128$-bit wide variants.
For this work, we focus on the $32$ and $64$ bit variants, since these
are the more mature and commercially relevant ones at present.

Various optional extensions are used to 
support additional functionality 
(e.g., floating-point, 
       via the 
       standard F~\cite[Section 11]{RV:ISA:I:19}
                and
                D~\cite[Section 12]{RV:ISA:I:19}
       extension),
or satisfy specific optimisation goals
(e.g., code density, 
       via the 
       standard C~\cite[Section 16]{RV:ISA:I:19}
       extension).

Further, RISC-V is a free to use, open standard managed by the independent
RISC-V Foundation.
This is in opposition to existing architectures such as ARM, which required
significant license fees to use.
This extensibility and openness makes RISC-V an excellent target for
computer architecture research.
