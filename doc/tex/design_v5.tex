\REFFIG{fig:mnemonics:v5} shows the mnemonics and pseudo-code functions
for variant 5.
These instructions use a {\em tiled} approach to representing the
AES state.
Figure ({\bf TODO}) shows how the traditional column-wise representaiton
of AES is changed such that each {\em quadrant} of the 16-byte state
is kept in a single $32$-bit register.

We can now compute the next round state of any quadrant by sourcing
only two other quadrants (registers) at a time, thus keeping within
the $2$-read-$1$-write constraint.

The state matrix and must be re-arranged before and after applying
the round functions, which adds a small overhead to this variant.
Similarly, the KeySchedule words must also be re-arranged to allow
AddRoundKey to be performed efficiently.
This can be done as a post-processing step in the key expansion.
