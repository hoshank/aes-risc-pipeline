We have surveyed and evaluated several ISEs for accelerating
the AES block cipher in the context of RISC-V.
We find that \ISE{3} has clear advantages for embedded class
$32$-bit cores, while \ISE{4} is a natural choice for taking
advantage of the wider data-path on $64$-bit systems.
For the $32$-bit case, we have also shown that with reasonable additional
hardware, it is possible to create a $1$'st order masked implementation with
modest performance and resource overheads.
