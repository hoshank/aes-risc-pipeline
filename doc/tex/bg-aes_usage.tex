The
Electronic Codebook Mode (ECB)~\cite[Section 6.1]{NIST:sp.800.38a}
captures ``raw'' use of AES as is.  However, demand for enhanced security
properties and/or functionality, for example, has led to use of AES in a
variety of {\em other} constructions.
Although not our focus per se, such use-cases are subtly important in the 
sense they inform or constrain the ISE interface: if the interface cannot 
support standard constructions, for example, then it cannot be deemed fit 
for purpose even {\em if} it supports AES as is.

\subsubsection{Modes of operation: ``AES plus insignificant extras''}

Some modes of operation use AES in combination with
insignificant 
additional operations
(e.g., XOR).
Pertinent examples include the following.

\paragraph{CBC.}

Encryption
and 
decryption
using
Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode
~\cite[Section 6.2]{NIST:sp.800.38a}
is outlined in
\REFALGO{alg:cbc:enc}
and
\REFALGO{alg:cbc:dec}
respectively:
note that it uses {\em both} AES encryption {\em and} decryption.

\paragraph{CTR.}

Encryption
and 
decryption
using
Counter               (CTR) mode
~\cite[Section 6.5]{NIST:sp.800.38a}
is outlined in
\REFALGO{alg:ctr:enc}
and
\REFALGO{alg:ctr:dec}
respectively:
note that it uses {\em only} AES encryption, and that suitable choices of 
the $iv$ and increment function~\cite[Appendix B]{NIST:sp.800.38a} $f$ are
required.

\subsubsection{Modes of operation: ``AES plus   significant extras''}

Some modes of operation use AES in combination with
  significant 
additional operations.  
We pay particular attention examples which combine the use of AES with
operations in the finite field $\F_{2^{128}}$ constructed as
$
\F_{2}[\IND{x}] / ( \IND{x}^{128} + \IND{x}^{7} + \IND{x}^{2} + \IND{x} + 1 ) .
$
Field 
      addition
and
multiplication
are denoted by
$\oplus$
and
$\otimes$
respectively:
a natural encoding/decoding is assumed, allowing conversion between field 
elements and, e.g., $128$-bit plaintexts or ciphertexts.
Whereas $\oplus$ can be realised in most ISAs using XOR, $\otimes$ can be
more problematic.  This has led many ISAs to include associated ISEs for
what is often termed ``carry-less'' multiplication; 
examples include
Intel via \VERB{PCLMULQDQ}~\cite[Page 4-241]{X86:2:18},
ARM   via \VERB{PMULL} and \VERB{PMULL2}~\cite[Section C7.2.215]{ARMv8-A:20},
and
SPARC via \VERB{XMULX} and \VERB{XMULXHI}~\cite[Section 7.143]{SPARC:16}.

\paragraph{GCM.}

The Galois Counter Mode (GCM)
~\cite{NIST:sp.800.38d}
supports authenticated encryption, using a parameterisable block cipher,
e.g., as AES-GCM when using AES; this is the {\em only} parameterisation
mandated by TLS 1.3~\cite[Section 9.1]{rfc:8446}.
AES-GCM is comprised of two components:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \ALG{GCTR}
      is responsible for 
          encryption,
      using AES; 
      a simplified description of
      ~\cite[Algorithm 3]{NIST:sp.800.38d}
      is presented in
      \REFALGO{alg:gctr}
      for completeness.

\item \ALG{GHASH}
      is responsible for
      authentication,
      using operations in $\F_{2^{128}}$;
      a simplified description of
      ~\cite[Algorithm 2]{NIST:sp.800.38d}
      is presented in
      \REFALGO{alg:ghash}
      for completeness,
      where the so-called hash key is
      $
      h = \SCOPE{\ID{AES}}{\ALG{Enc}}( k, 0 ) .
      $

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{XTS-AES.}

The XTS-AES mode 
~\cite{NIST:sp.800.38e}
is an AES-specific instantiation of the XEX (XOR Encrypt XOR) tweakable
block cipher of Rogaway~\cite{Rogaway:04};
rather than ``data in transit'', XTS-AES is designed to support access
to ``data at rest'' on some block-addressable storage medium.
\REFALGO{alg:xts:enc}
and
\REFALGO{alg:xts:dec}
capture the XTS-AES encryption and decryption respectively, noting that 
$
\alpha = \IND{x} .
$

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Other}

Various other constructions use components {\em in} AES, rather than AES
{\em itself}.
For example,
the Gr{\o}stl~\cite{GKMMRST:11} hash function
(a SHA-3  candidate)
uses the AES S-box~\cite[Section 4.3]{GKMMRST:11},
and
the YAES~\cite{BosVer:14} authenticated encryption scheme
(a CAESAR candidate)
uses the full AES round~\cite[Section 1.3]{BosVer:14}.
