Many embedded implementations of AES include the possibility of
power side-channel in their threat model.
Having identified AES version $3$ detailed in
\REFSEC{sec:design:v3} as the best candidate, we now show a possible
way of extending the ISE further to add power side-channel resistance
with minimal area and performance overheads.
